# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter-like web app.

## Final product
The final product has a character counter, warning errors, and responsive design, it also has a toggle which can be clicked to write a new tweet, and one that can be clicked to bring the user back to the top of the page when scrolling. It is built with ajax for a smooth user experience, along with jQuery.
